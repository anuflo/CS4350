<h1 style="color: #D4AF37;"><strong>CS4350 Game Development Project</strong>  </h1>
<h1 style="color: #D4AF37;">Learning Outcomes</h1>
<p>This project-based course offers students the opportunity to work in teams to design and develop a game by following the key stages of the game development process. The course emphasises the design and implementation of core dynamics, game mechanics, player strategy, progression systems, balancing, level design, user interfaces, and technical features such as 3D graphics, animation, artificial intelligence, physics, and networking. For the teams which are continuing the game from CS3247, the focus will be on game balancing, polishing, novel software patterns and additional levels.</p>
<p>Students will apply software engineering principles throughout the development lifecycle. They will also analyse existing games, explore market trends and opportunities, pitch original game concepts, and evaluate designs through structured playtests to understand user needs. Development will follow appropriate software development models and project management methodologies.</p>
<p>In addition to technical skills, the course fosters teamwork, communication, and professional presentation. Students will also learn to build a portfolio to support careers in the game industry.</p>

<h1 style="color: #D4AF37;">Project Information</h1>
<p>Most of the games developed in this course will be extension of the games developed in CS3247 Game Development course. However, a few new games will be allowed if the ideas are interesting and the team has capability to complete.  </p>
<h3 style="color: #003366;">Themes Recommended for this Semester's Projects:  </h3>
<p><strong>1)  Games to exhibit Innovative Software Engineering or Coding Approach in Game Development. </strong>Plan an approach, use it in implementation, evaluate it why it is good and present. Reference: <a href="https://conf.researchr.org/home/icse-2026/gas-2026" rel="noopener" target="_blank"> https://conf.researchr.org/home/icse-2026/gas-2026 and</a><a href="https://sites.google.com/view/gas-2024" rel="noopener" target="_blank"> https://sites.google.com/view/icsegasworkshop2025</a><strong> </strong></p>
<p><strong>2)  </strong><strong>Serious Games with Novel idea. </strong>Like, educational game with GenAI (LLM) integration.</p>
<p>eg. Equity Trading Game: Human vs AI game. [Suitable for teams with experience/interest in trading and ML].  Example gameplay. There will be 'n' rounds. Each round, AI will buy/sell shares and the player will also buy/sell shares. Compare the outcome and choose the winner of the round. </p>
<p><strong>3)  </strong><strong>Games to exhibit Artificial creativity </strong>-  Game with 'Artificial creativity in game content generation (PCG)'. Use of modern GenAI tools in the development process is encouraged.  [Suitable for teams focusing on AI/ML and Games area]. </p>
<p><strong>4)</strong> <strong>VR Games for KAT-WALK-MINI-S </strong>(VR treadmill) - <a href="https://www.kat-vr.com/products/kat-walk-mini-s" rel="noopener" target="_blank">https://www.kat-vr.com/products/kat-walk-mini-sLinks to an external site.</a>. [We have 2 new units in Metaverse Foundry]. It can be a simple game with a novel research study. </p>
<p><strong>5)</strong> <strong>Others</strong> [should have either unique selling points or research component]. (encouraged the use of new technologies - VR/AR, Cryptocurrency/NFT, PCG with Machine Learning, Machine Learning/Analytics tool for Unity/Unreal asset store) </p>
<h3 style="color: #003366;">Research Study</h3>
<p>1) <strong>DERC: </strong>If you are planning for a research study which requires user survey, pls apply for Department Ethics Review Committee (DERC)  clearance @ <a href="https://derc.comp.nus.edu.sg/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">https://derc.comp.nus.edu.sg/</a>.

Alternatively, you can develop assets for asset stores [eg. Path finding Tool for Unity Asset Store] and show traction.<br/>- AND Satisfying one of the following TRACK requirements.</p>
<p>A: [COMMERCIAL TRACK] Planned towards creating a inde-game company (Web presence is required early, during the course) or partnered with local arcades/companies for publication. You should submit a business plan and show some traction (number of downloads or players) for you game published online. <br/>B: [RESEARCH TRACK] Should have a Research Hypothesis and Evaluation plan (user study and objective evaluation). Write a paper for publication. Plan the publication venue in the beginning [by week2] and work towards to deadline. If the submission system opens  after the sem, you can prepare all materials by the end of the sem and submit later.<br/>C. [COMPETITION TRACK] Planned to submit to a competition. Make sure that you know the rules and regulations of the selected competition early [week 2] and work towards the deadline. If the submission system opens  after the sem, you can prepare all materials by the end of the sem and submit later.<br/>D. [SOCIAL TRACK] deployed the project for social good, educational, community and government partners (NUS departments or Beyond]. Try to get a reference letter from the client on completion of the project.</p>
